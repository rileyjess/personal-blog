# Blog

## Description
This project is a blog that allows the user to input a username, title, and content, which is saved to local storage and displayed on the blog page when the user submits the form. The page also features a button that changes the theme. 

Acceptance Criteria:

- When the page loads, the user is presented with the landing page containing a form with labels and inputs for username, blog title, and blog content.
- When the user submits the form, the blog post data is stored to localStorage.
- When the form submits, the user is redirected to the posts page.
- If the user tries to submit a form without a username, title, or content, they are presented with a message that prompts me to complete the form.
- When the user views the posts page, they are presented with a header, with a light mode/dark mode toggle, and a "Back" button.
- When they click the light mode/dark mode toggle, the page content's styles update to reflect the selection.
- When the user clicks the "Back" button, they are redirected back to the landing page where I can input more blog entries.
- When they view the main content, they are presented with a list of blog posts that are pulled from localStorage.
- When the user views localStorage, they are presented with a JSON array of blog post objects, each including the post author's username, title of the post, and post's content.
- When the user takes a closer look at a single blog entry in the list, they can see can see the title, the content, and the author of the post.
- When the user views the footer, they are presented with a link to the developer's portfolio.
